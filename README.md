# 8599 Ray Tracer

This repository aims to record a path tracer that I am currently writing for the course CSC8599.

### Objectives:

- Follow closely to [this book by Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) to prototype an offine path tracer.
- Try to make the path tracer real-time. E.g. using DirectX RayTracing i.e. DXR.
- Improve the ray-tracer by following closely to [the next book by Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html).
